# plotly-challenge
In this project, I used JavaScript, Plotly.js,HTML and CSS to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. I was able to build three graphs using Plotly and JavaScript.
The bar graph shows the top ten samples for a particular sample id. Thebubble chart shows all the samples and OTU ID data points. Metadata for the sample is also displayed, along with a guage chart for washing frequency.
